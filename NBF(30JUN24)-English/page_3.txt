Review report on condensed consolidat ed interim financial 
information  to the board of directors of Nati onal Bank of 
Fujairah PJSC  
  
Introduction 
 
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated interim statement of financial position of 
National Bank of Fujairah PJSC (“the Bank”) and its subsidiaries (together referred to as “the Group”) as 
at 30 June 2024  and the related condensed consolidated interim statements of income  and 
comprehensive income for the three -month and si x months periods then ended and the condensed 
consolidated interim statement of cash flows  and changes in equity  for six month s period then ended and 
explanatory notes . The directors are responsible  for the preparation and presentation of this condensed 
consolidated interim financial information in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 – 
Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this conde nsed 
consolidated interim financial information based on our review.  
  
 
Scope of review 
 
We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, 
“Review of interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity.” A review of 
the condensed consolidated interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedure s. A 
review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of 
all significant matters that might be identified  in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying 
condensed consolidated interim financial information is not prepared, in all material respects, in 
accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”.
