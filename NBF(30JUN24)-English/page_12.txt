(b)    Fair value hierarchy  
The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of 
the inputs used in making the measurements:  
 
▪ Level 1: Quoted market price (unadjusted) in an active market for an identical instrument. A financial 
instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available 
from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry, gro up, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices 
represent actual and regularly recurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.  
▪ Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable input, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., 
derived from prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active 
markets for similar instruments; quoted pr ices for identical or similar instruments; or other valuation 
techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.  
▪ Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs. This category includes all 
instruments where the valuation technique includes inputs based on observable data and the unobservable 
inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. T his category includes instruments that are 
valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or 
assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.
