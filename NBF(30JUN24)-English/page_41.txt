21.  Tax 
  
Implementation of UAE Corporation Tax Law and application of IAS 12 Income Taxes  
 
On 09 December 2022, UAE Federal Decree Law No. 47 of 2022 was published setting in place a general 
corporate income tax for the first time. The taxable income threshold, of upto AED 375,000 will be taxed at 
0% and beyond AED 375,000 will be taxed at 9%, w ill apply as clarified via Cabinet Decision No. 116 of 
2022 published on 16 January 2023; and at this point the tax law was considered enacted and substantively 
enacted for accounting purposes. The UAE Tax Law has confirmed the application of the Corporate  Tax 
(‘CT’) to tax periods commencing on or after 01 June 2023. Therefore, NBF’s effective date of applying the 
CT regime is the current financial year commencing from 01 January 2024. The Bank’s registration was 
concluded and the certificate of registration was issued by the Federal Tax Authority ( FTA) in May 2024. 
Current taxes are now payable for the year starting 01 January 2024 potentially leading to a corresponding 
impact on deferred tax liabilities and assets; where the carrying amount differs from the tax base.  
 
Whilst a number of Tax Guides have been issued by the F TA to help taxable persons understand the 
provisions of the CT law, it is expected that further guides would be issued in the coming periods to provide 
further clarity on the application and interpretation of the UAE Tax Law. This will be monitored closely b y 
the management to assess any relevant impact on NBF’s tax position.  
 
Based on the review and assessment, a deferred tax asset has been recognized, amounting to  AED 1.05 
million , as at 30 June 2024 , arising from items that may be reclassified subsequently to the statement of 
income, from other comprehensive income perspective. Further, the current tax impact has been calculated 
considering the potential adjustments which has resulted in an effective  tax rate of  9.02%.
