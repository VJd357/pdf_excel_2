8. Loans and advances and Islamic financing receivables (continued)  
8.6 Risk mitigation, credit quality, collateral and credit enhancements (continued)  
 
The amount and type of collateral depends on assessments of the credit risk of the counterparty. The types 
of collateral mainly include cash, guarantees, stand -by letter of credit (bank guarantee), pledge over listed 
shares and mortgage and liens over prop erties or other securities over assets. Pledged interests over 
vehicles, ships and equipment are also obtained. Collateral generally is not held against non -trading 
investments and due from banks and financial institutions.  
Management monitors the market value of collateral, and wherever necessary the Group requests 
additional collateral in accordance with the underlying agreement, and considers collateral obtained during 
its review of the adequacy of the allowance for impair ment losses.  
Estimates of fair value are generally assessed on a periodic basis in accordance with the respective credit 
policies.  
The credit quality of the loans and advances and Islamic financing receivables is managed by the Group 
using internal credit ratings comprising 22 grades. The risk rating system is used as a credit risk 
management tool whereby any risks taken on the Group’s bo oks are rated against a set of predetermined 
standards which are in line with the Central Bank of the UAE guidelines.  
The Group’s Credit Risk Rating Methodology reflects its assessment of the probability of default of 
individual counterparties mapped to the ratings specified by the External Credit Assessment Institutions 
(ECAIs). The mapping is based on a statistical mode l which takes into consideration the industry weights, 
country specific factors and the sensitivity of the counter party to systematic risk. Risk classification 
distribution by risk grades is presented below:
