Standardized Approach, the Bank is following the standardized measurement approach for credit, market a nd 
operational risk, under the existing Pillar 1 of Basel III requirements with the addition of the respective changes 
pertinent to capital supply.  
The quantitative requirements, based on the regulations / guidelines, have been detailed below:  
i. Total regulatory capital (net of regulatory adjustments) – at least 10.5% of risk weighted assets (RWAs) 
– comprises of two tiers:  
a. Tier 1 capital – at least 8.5% of RWA, composed of:  
▪ Common equity Tier 1 (CET1) – at least 7.0% of RWA; and  
▪ Additional Tier 1 (AT1)  
 
Common equity Tier 1 (CET1) includes ordinary share capital, statutory reserve, special reserve,
