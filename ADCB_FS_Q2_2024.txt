INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON REVIEW OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED 
INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION  TO  
THE BOARD OF D IRECTORS OF 
ABU DHABI COMMERCIAL BANK PJSC  
Introduction  
 
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated  interim  statement of financial position of Abu 
Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (the “Bank”)  and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) as at 3 0 
June 2024 , and the related income statement for the three and six -month period then ended , and the related 
statement s of comprehensive income,  changes in equity and cash flows for the six-month period then ended , 
and material accounting policy information and other explanatory notes . Management is responsible for the 
preparation and presentation of th is interim  financial information  in accordance with International Accounting 
Standard  34 Interim Financial Reporting  (“IAS 34”). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on th is 
interim financial information  based on our review.  
 
Scope of Review  
 
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, “ Review 
of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity ”. A review of interim 
financial information  consists of making inquiries,  primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope 
than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and conseque ntly does not 
enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in 
an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  
 
Conclusion  
 
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim 
financial information is  not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34.  
 
Other Matter 
 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended  31 December 202 3 and interim financial  
information  for the six-month period ended  30 June 2023 were audited and reviewed  respectively  by another 
auditor  who expressed an unmodified opinion and unmodified conclusion  on those statements and that 
information on  31 January  2024 and 20 July  2023  respectively.

2.   Summary of material  accounting policies (continued)  
 
2.3   Basis of consolidation (continued)  
 
Transactions eliminated on consolidation  
 
All intragroup balances , income, expenses and cash flows resulting from intragroup transactions are 
eliminated on consolidation.  
 
Investment in associate s 
 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power 
to participat e in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not control or joint control 
over those policies.  
 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The cost of the investments includes transaction costs.  
 
The condensed consolidated interim financial information includes the Group’s share of the profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income of investment in associate s, after adjustments to align the accounting policies 
with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant 
influence ceases.  
 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity -accounted investee, the carrying amount 
of the investment, including any long -term interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero, and the 
recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has 
made payments on behalf of the investee.  
 
Joint arrangements  
 
Joint arrangements are arrangements of which the Group has joint control, established by contracts requiring 
unanimous consent for decisions about the activities that significantly affect the arrangements’ returns. They 
are classified and accounted for as follows:  
 
Joint operation – when the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to an 
arrangement, it accounts for each of its assets, liabilities and transactions, including its share of those held 
or incurred jointly, i n relation to the joint operation.  
 
Joint venture – when the Group has rights only to the net assets of the arrangements, it accounts for its 
interest using the equity method, as for associates.  
 
3. Taxation  
 
On December  9, 2022, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Ministry of Finance (MoF) released Federal Decree -
Law N o 47 of 2022 on the Taxation of Corporations and Businesses, Corporate Tax Law (CT Law) to enact a 
new CT regime in the UAE. The new CT regime has become effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after June  1, 2023. As the Group’s accounting year ends on December  31, the first tax period will be the period 
from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, with the respective tax return to be filed on or before Septe mber 
30, 2025.  
  
The taxable income of the entities that are in scope for UAE CT purposes will be subject to the rate of 9% on 
taxable profits above AED 375,000 . It is not currently foreseen that the Group’s UAE operations will be 
subject to the applicatio n of the Glob al Minimum Tax rate of 15% in financial year 2024. The application is 
dependent on the implementation of Base Erosion Pro fit Shifting (BEPS 2) -  Pillar T wo rules by countries 
where the Group  operates and the enactment of Pillar T wo rules by th e UAE MoF.

Fair valuations  
 
Valuations are carried out annually by registered independent valuers having an appropriate recognised 
professional qualification and experience in the location and category of the property being valued . In 
estimating the fair values of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. 
 
The valuation methodologies considered by external valuers include:  
 
 Direct co mparable method: This method seeks to determine the value of the property from transactions 
of comparable propertie s in the vicinity applying adjustments to reflect differences to the subject 
property.  
 Investment method: This method is used to assess the value of the property by capitalising the net operating income of the property at an appropriate yield an investor w ould expect for an investment of 
the duration of the interest being valued.  
 
Investment properties of the Group are primarily located within the UAE.

20.   Capital notes  
 
Additional Tier I capital notes (the “Capital Notes”) are non -cumulative perpetual securities for which there 
is no fixed redemption date. These Capital Notes are direct, unsecured, conditional, and subordinated 
obligations of the Bank and (i) rank pari passu  without any preference among themselves; (ii) rank 
subordinate and junior to all senior obligations; (iii) rank pari passu with all pari passu  obligations; and  (iv) 
rank in priority only to all junior creditors.  
 
In case the Bank at its sole discretion elects not to make a coupon payment, the holders of the Capital Notes 
do not have a right to claim the coupon and an election by the Bank not to service the coupon is not 
considered an event of default. In addition, there are certain circumstances (“non -payment event”) under 
which the Bank is prohibited from making a coupon payment on a relevant coupon payment date. Further, if 
the CBUAE notifies the Bank that  it is, or will become, non -viable without (i) a write -down; or (ii) a public 
sector injection of capital, the rights of the holders of the Capital Notes under the Capital Notes shall automatically be deemed to be irrevocably, unconditionally and permanent ly written -down in a proportion 
corresponding to the write -down amount determined by the CBUAE. This could result in Capital Notes being 
written down to zero and the Capital Notes being cancelled.  
 
If the Bank makes a non -payment election or a non- payment event occurs, then the Bank will not (a) declare 
or pay any distribution or dividend or (b) redeem, purchase, cancel, reduce or otherwise acquire any of the 
share capital or any securities of the Bank ranking pari passu  with or junior to the Capital Notes except notes, 
the term of which stipulate a mandatory redemption or conversion into equity, in each case unless or until 
one coupon payment has been paid in full.

33.   Fair value hierarchy  
 
Fair value measurements recognised in the condensed consolidated interim financial information  
 
The fair value measurements are categorised into different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the 
inputs to valuation techniques used. The different levels are defined as follows:   
 
Quoted market prices – Level 1  
 
Financial instruments are classified as Level 1 if their values are observable in an active market. Such 
instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active 
markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring 
market transactions.    
 
Valuation techniques using observable inputs – Level 2  
 
Financial instruments classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable in an 
active market. Valuation based on observable inputs includes financial instruments such as swaps and 
forwards which are valued using market standard  pricing techniques and options that are commonly traded 
in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.  
 
The category includes derivative financial instruments such as over the counter (OTC) derivatives, 
commodity de rivatives, foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, certain investment securities, financial 
assets at FVTPL, euro commercial paper and borrowings. Valuation of the derivative financial instruments is made through discounted cash flow method using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the 
instruments for non -optional derivatives and standard option pricing models such as Black -Scholes and 
other valuation models for derivatives with options.   
 
The Group periodically reviews its valuation techni ques including the adopted methodologies and model 
calibrations. However, the base models may not fully capture all factors relevant to the valuation of the 
Group’s financial instruments such as credit risk  and funding costs. Therefore, the Group applies v arious 
techniques to estimate the credit risk associated with its financial instruments measured at fair value, which 
include a portfolio -based approach that estimates the expected net exposure per counterparty over the full 
lifetime of the individual assets, in order to reflect the credit risk of the individual counterparties for non -
collateralised financial instruments. Credit valuation adjustment is calculated by applying Monte -carlo 
simulation models.

33.   Fair value hierarchy (continued)  
 
Valuation  techniques using observable inputs – Level 2 (continued)  
 
Collateral and netting arrangements are taken into account where applicable. The Group applies credit value 
adjustments to all relevant OTC positions with the exception of positions settled through central clearing 
houses.   
 
Funding value adjustment (FVA)  reflects the impact of funding associated with collateralised and partly 
collateralised OTC positions. The Group calculates the FVA by applying estimated future funding costs to the expected future exposure that the Group will be required to fund as a res ult of the uncollateralised 
component of the OTC portfolio (i.e. the uncollateralised component of a collateralised portfolio and the entire uncollateralised portfolio).  
 
Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs – Level 3  
 
Financial instruments are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). A valuation input is considered observable if it can 
be directly observed from transactio ns in an active market.  
 
Unobservable input levels are generally determined based on observable inputs of a similar nature, historical 
observations, or other analytical techniques. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when 
available. The Group  considers relevant and observable market prices in its valuations where possible.  
 Financial instruments under this category mainly include private equity instruments, funds and loans and 
advances to customers mandatorily measured at FVTPL. The carrying values of these investments are 
adjusted as follows:  
 
a) Private equity instruments – using the latest available net book value;  
b) Funds – based on the net asset value provided by the fund manager; and  
c) Loans and advances to customers mandatorily measur ed at FVTPL – using valuation provided by external 
consultants as per discounted cash flow methodology.  
 
Investment properties are classified as Level 3 as their valuation incorporates significant unobservable 
inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Group’s investment 
properties are rental income and capitalisation rates. Significant decrease in rental income, or increase in 
capitalisation rates, in isolation would result in  a significant lower fair value measurement. Generally, a 
change in the assumption used for rental income should be accompanied by a change in the assumption for capitalisation rates in the same direction as increase in rental income raises the expectation s of the seller to 
earn from the investment property. Therefore, the effects of these changes partially offset each other. Refer note 1 1 in respect of valuation methodology used for investment properties.  
 
Except as detailed in the following table, the Man agement considers that the carrying amounts of financial 
assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements do not materially differ from their 
fair values.
